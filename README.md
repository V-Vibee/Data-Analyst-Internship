Under the guidance of Team KH, I got andive into the Career Aspirations of Gen-z and create a Power BI Dashboard that showcases the key metrics influencing the Gen-Z folks in choosing their career. This visualization also consists of other indicators like preferred Work model, Working Environments, and Career Roles by Gen-Z.

Our project aimed to shed light on their career aspirations and provide valuable insights through our Power BI dashboard.
